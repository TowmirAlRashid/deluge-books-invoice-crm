# deluge-books-invoice-crm

the [books-to-crm-invoice](https://github.com/TowmirAlRashid/deluge-books-invoice-crm/blob/main/books-to-crm-invoice) is a deluge code that operates as follows:

1. First an invoice is created in Zoho Books.
2. If the response gives us confirmation that an invoice has indeed been created in books, then an invoice is created in Zoho CRM. 
3. Necessary data to create invoice in crm is collected from books response.
